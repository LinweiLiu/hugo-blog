### **Hacker Ethics**

*   **Access to computers—and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!**
*   **All information should be free.**
*   **Mistrust Authority—Promote Decentralization.**
*   **Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.**
*   **You can create art and beauty on a computer.**
*   **Computers can change your life for the better.**
